## Description: Nintendo App (Donkey Kong Journey) ##
Version: 1.7 <br>
Created: 2019-12-02 <br>

I developed a simple iOS Application using Swift in Xcode, just to provide a basic validation run (Smoke Testing).

## Very Important: ## 
The purpose of this "App" is to provide an overview of the automation procedures and the available resources.
Metroid and Donkey Kong images: Nintendo owns intellectual property rights in its products. These includes copyrights, trademarks, and patents.

The reason I used these images was only because I love Nintendo Games, and I prefer to show my knowledge joining my passions.
